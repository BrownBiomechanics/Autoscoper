# Get Help

Contact the [SlicerAutoscoperM community](/about.md#contact-us) if you have any questions, bug reports, or enhancement requests - following the guidelines described below.

## I need help in using Autoscoper

- The most up-to-date information sources are the [SlicerAutoscoperM category](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicerautoscoperm/30) on the Slicer Discourse forum and the [Autoscoper documentation on Read-the-Docs](https://autoscoper.readthedocs.io). Google may find older discussions on former [simtk](https://simtk.org/projects/autoscoper) forum pages, which may or may not be exactly accurate for the current version of Autoscoper, but may still provide useful hints.
- Try your best to sort out the issue by reading [documentation](https://autoscoper.readthedocs.io) and [portfolio of training materials](https://autoscoper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html).
- If you are still unclear about what to do: [ask a question on the SlicerAutoscoperM category](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicerautoscoperm/30) on the Slicer Discourse forum. In addition to describing the specific question, it helps if you describe the context of your question (who you are, what you are working on, why it is important, what is the overall goal of your project). Knowing more about you and your project increases the chance that somebody volunteers to answer the question, and you may get a more relevant answer.

## I want to report a problem

If you are not sure if Autoscoper behave incorrectly or you are not using it properly then [ask about it on the SlicerAutoscoperM category](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicerautoscoperm/30) on the Slicer Discourse forum. If you are _sure_ that Autoscoper is not working as intended then [submit a bug report in the Autoscoper issue tracker](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/Autoscoper/issues).

If you already know to witch component your request pertains, you may explicitly use the [SlicerAutoscoperM](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/SlicerAutoscoperM/issues) or [Autoscoper](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/SlicerAutoscoperM/issues) issue tracker.

## I would like to request enhancement or new feature

First search on the [SlicerAutoscoperM category](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicerautoscoperm/30) on the Slicer Discourse forum and in the [SlicerAutoscoperM issue tracker](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/SlicerAutoscoperM/issues) or [Autoscoper issue tracker](https://github.com/BrownBiomechanics/Autoscoper/issues) to see if someone asked for this feature already. If you find a very similar request, tell us that you are interested in it too by adding a comment and/or adding a "thumbs-up" to the top post.

If you cannot find a similar feature request, then write a post in the [SlicerAutoscoperM category](https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicerautoscoperm/30) on the Slicer Discourse forum to discuss it with Autosoper developers and community members.
