# Getting Started

The official method of obtaining Autoscoper is through the extension mechanism of 3D Slicer. To obtain Autoscoper, please first install the latest preview release of [3D Slicer](https://download.slicer.org/) and use the [Extensions Manager](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/extensions_manager.html) to search for and install the SlicerAutoscoperM extension. After restarting 3D Slicer, the AutoscoperM module will be available in the application.

Autoscoper is distributed through SlicerAutoscoperM (SAM), a free, open source and multi-platform 3D Slicer extension. To learn more about the relationship between Autoscoper and AutoscoperM, see https://autoscoperm.slicer.org/.
