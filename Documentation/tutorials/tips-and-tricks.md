# Ticks and Tricks for Aligning Partial Volumes

This tutorial contains a collection of tips and tricks for aligning partial volumes. This tutorial assumes that you have already read the [Loading and Tracking](./loading-and-tracking.md) tutorial and have loaded data into Autoscoper.

## Translation in two dimensions

To help align a partial volume, it may be beneficial to remove a degree of freedom, temporarily, from the translational movement. To do this, you need to rotate the partial volume until one of the axes is no longer visible when in translation mode. For example, if you want to remove the x-axis from the translation, you need to rotate the partial volume until the x-axis is no longer visible. This can be done by clicking and dragging on the partial volume in the 3D view. Once the axis is no longer visible, you can translate the partial volume in the x-axis without affecting the other axes.
