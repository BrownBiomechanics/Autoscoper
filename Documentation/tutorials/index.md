These tutorials assume you are familiar with the [Autoscoper's User Interface](../user-interface.md).

A series of tutorials are available to help you get started using the SlicerAutoscoperM modules.

Users who are new to BVR tracking can follow the [](./loading-and-tracking.md) tutorial, which will walk you through the process of loading sample data and tracking a bone. If you have data and are ready to use Autoscoper for tracking, the [](./pre-processing-module.md) and [](./custom-data.md) tutorials walk users through the process of preparing your data for use with Autoscoper.  [](./filters.md), will walk you through the process of creating and applying filters to your data.
