# VIE (Filter) File Specification

## Overview

The filter file is a `.vie` file and contains all of the information to load a set of filters for one camera into Autoscoper. The same file can be used for multiple cameras. The file is organized similar to HTML with opening and closing tags. The values for each filter are still key value pairs.

```{warning}
The VIE is automatically generated by the Autoscoper GUI. It is not recommended to edit the file manually. This page exists for documentation purposes.

For more information on how to use the GUI to add and adjust filters, see the [Rendering and Filters](../tutorials/filters.md) tutorial.
```

## Tags and Attributes

Tags are opened with the `_begin` suffix and closed with the `_end` suffix. Attributes are key value pairs that are contained within the tags. The value of the attribute should be a number.

| Tag | Attributes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RadFilters` | `SobelFilter` tag, `ContrastFilter` tag, `GaussianFilter` tag, and `SharpenFilter` tag | Specifies the beginning and end of the filters that are applied to the radiograph renderer. |
| `DrrRenderer` | `SampleDistance`, `RayIntensity`, and Cutoff | Specifies the Ray casting settings for the DRR renderer. |
| `DrrFilters` | `SobelFilter` tag, `ContrastFilter` tag, `GaussianFilter` tag, and `SharpenFilter` tag | Specifies the beginning and end of the filters that are applied to the DRR renderer. |
| `SobelFilter` | `Scale` and `Blend` | Specifies the Sobel filter. |
| `ContrastFilter` | `Alpha` and `Beta` | Specifies the contrast filter. |
| `GaussianFilter` | `Radius` | Specifies the Gaussian filter. |
| `SharpenFilter` | `Radius` and `Contrast` | Specifies the sharpen filter. |
