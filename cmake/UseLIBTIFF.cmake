#
# Tries to find a pre-installed version of LIBTIFF on this system using find_package().
# Case 1: If found, then the script uses target_link_library() to link it to your target.
# Case 2: If not found and AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES is ON, then the script immediately
# downloads, builds, and installs the LIBTIFF library to the location specifed by
# CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Then, it tries find_package() again and links to the newly install
# library.
# Case 3: If not found and AUTOBUILD_DEPENDENCIES is OFF, then the script exits with a
# fatal error.

# Usage: In your CMakeLists.txt, somewhere after you define the target that depends
# on the LIBTIFF library (typical with something like add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ...)
# or add_library(${PROJECT_NAME} ...)), add the following two lines:

#    include(UseLIBTIFF)
#    UseLIBTIFF(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE)

# The second argument can be either PUBLIC, PRIVATE, or INTERFACE, following the keyword
# usage described here:
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html
