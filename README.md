This repository is created by [Bardiya Akhbari](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bardiya_Akhbari) for additional debugging and implementing support for Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Currently, the code has been optimized for CUDA, and particle swarm optimization method has been added to the registration options. Autoscoper 2 has been developed by [Dr. Ben Knorlein](https://www.ccv.brown.edu/about/staff). In order to simplify installation and compilation the build system has been changed to CMake and the UI has been switched to QT5. Version 2 has improved processing, several bugfixes and new functionality, e.g. multibone, batch processing, when compared to the original versions.


# Installer for Autoscoper v2.7 #
The installer for Autoscoper 2.7.1 can be find [on SimTk website](https://simtk.org/projects/autoscoper).

You need to install the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?), and update your graphics card driver to run the application.

# History of Autoscoper #
Autoscoper 1 was developed by Andy Loomis (original CUDA version) and [Mark Howison (OpenCL)](https://bitbucket.org/mhowison/xromm-autoscoper).

Autoscoper was revamped and upgraded to version 2 by Dr. Ben Knorlein. Multi-bone tracking feature was added and a socket was design for interaction with Matlab.

Currently, Bardiya Akhbari maintains the software and debugs the reported issues.
